# React Native - Project

This repository was created using `npx create-expo-app`.  It contains code and other attachments for our React Native-MVP.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 12.4 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.dev) can be used to work around this.

## Building a React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native][hello-world]
- [Creating a New Application][new-app]
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application][existing]

[hello-world]: https://snack.expo.dev/@samples/hello-world
[new-app]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
[existing]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps

## ðŸ“– Documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on the [website][docs].

The React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation][r-docs].

The source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [**@facebook/react-native-website**][repo-website].

Run this project by cloning this repo locally and running `npm install` followed by `npm start`.  If developing on an Iphone, also follow the directions above to download the [Expo App](https://expo.dev).  `npm start` will run the local build and provide you with a QR code that will spin up the serve on your mobile device, which will update automagically with changes made to the code.
