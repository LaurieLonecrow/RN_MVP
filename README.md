# React Native - Project

This repository was created using `npx create-expo-app`.  It contains code and other attachments for our React Native-MVP.

## Running The Provided Code

Run this project by cloning this repo locally and running `npm install` followed by `npm start`.  If developing on an Iphone, also follow these directions to download the [Expo App](https://expo.dev).  `npm start` will run the local build and provide you with a QR code that will spin up the serve on your mobile device, which will update automagically with changes made to the code.  

The initial screen will give you various options to Signin, but for demo purposes use `Sign In with Email`.
  email address: `test@test.com` / password: `password`

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 12.4 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.dev) can be used to work around this.

## Building a React Native app

The [Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) is a good reference for creating a new project. The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:
